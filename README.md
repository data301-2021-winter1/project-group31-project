## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The dataset we have chosen is titled NHL Game Data and was created by Martin Ellis on September 26, 2018, and was most recently updated on December 11, 2020. The dataset is compiled of information including demographics of players and statistics taken from each game played. The information provided in the dataset would generally be used for public interest or fun but could be interpreted by professionals within the NHL to analyze and use for real decisions. The dataset is collected using an application programming interface. The problem that we may encounter with the dataset is that is os collected from the past and has not been updated to the current day so when the research questions are being stated they will need to be framed in the past. The easiest data to interpret will be the demographics of the player since it is listed with the player's names right next to the information. Where other information such as goals per game are listed under game id which would have to be searched up and referenced with players.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

With this data analytics project, we hope to investigate any correlations between NHL player demographics and team compositions to better understand how teams utilize player demographics to create their lineups. Jeremy is very knowledgeable about the NHL and has been a fan for years; he is interested in using the project to gain a deeper understanding of the sport he greatly enjoys. Noah has been a casual fan for a while and he has recently become more interested in hockey; he is looking to use this project as a way to learn more about the sport and its various intricacies. A question we specifically wish to explore is what demographics are under or over-represented in the NHL and if individual teams build their teams with a higher focus on players with specific demographics. We believe that we can build a dashboard to represent the dataset we are attempting to analyze, but we currently lack the skills to do so. We believe as the course progresses we will learn the skills necessary to create the dashboard.
