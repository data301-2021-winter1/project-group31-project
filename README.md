The dataset we have chosen is titled NHL Game Data and was created by Martin Ellis on September 26, 2018, and was most recently updated on December 11, 2020. The dataset is compiled of information including demographics of players and statistics taken from each game played. The information provided in the dataset would generally be used for public interest or fun but could be interpreted by professionals within the NHL to analyze and use for real decisions. The dataset is collected using an application programming interface. The problem that we may encounter with the dataset is that is os collected from the past and has not been updated to the current day so when the research questions are being stated they will need to be framed in the past. The easiest data to interpret will be the demographics of the player since it is listed with the player's names right next to the information. Where other information such as goals per game are listed under game id which would have to be searched up and referenced with players.
